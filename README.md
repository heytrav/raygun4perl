raygun4perl
===========

Talk to the Raygun.io API in Perl.



Notes
=====


Although this module should install without an API key from raygun.io, you will need one for it to be of any use. By default, it uses whatever is in the RAYGUN_API_KEY environment variable, but this is mainly so that the tests can be run without any user interaction.
